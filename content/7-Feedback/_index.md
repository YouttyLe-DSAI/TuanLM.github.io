Overall Evaluation
1. Working environment The working environment is very friendly and open. Members in FCJ are always willing to help when I face difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, which helps me stay focused.

2. Support from mentor / admin team The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly whenever I don’t understand something, and always encourages me to ask questions.

3. Alignment between work and field of study The tasks I was assigned are aligned with the knowledge I learned at school, while also expanding into new areas I had never been exposed to before. Thanks to that, I was able to both reinforce my foundational knowledge and learn practical skills related to DevOps and Cloud.

4. Learning opportunities & skill development During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and how to communicate professionally in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared a lot of real-world experience that helped me better shape my career direction.

5. Culture & team spirit The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still maintains a cheerful atmosphere. When there are urgent projects, everyone puts in effort together and supports one another regardless of position. This makes me feel like I am part of the team, even though I am only an intern.

6. Policies / benefits for interns The company provides internship allowance and offers flexibility in working hours when necessary. In addition, being able to join internal training sessions is a major plus.
